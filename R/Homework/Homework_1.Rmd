```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Show the 10 police stations with the most car theft in the SP. State.  Use the “ssp” base present in the “data” folder in the course material.

```{r cars}
library(dplyr)

ssp <- readr::read_rds("data/casas.rds")
#saveRDS(ssp, file = "data/ssp.rds")
View(ssp)
glimpse(ssp)

ssp |> arrange(desc(furto_veiculos))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
